# Visualizing-Inequalities-in-Life-Expectancy
Compare life expectancy across countries and genders with ggplot2.

Do women live longer than men? How long? Does it happen everywhere? Is life expectancy increasing? Everywhere? Which is the country with the lowest life expectancy? Which is the one with the highest? In this Project, I have manipulated data using dplyr library and visualized United Nations life expectancy data using ggplot2 to find these answers.
